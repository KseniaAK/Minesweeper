# Minesweeper
Minesweeper game built with React-Redux

### Current Status
Currently, you can play the game by uncovering the cells - a number would signify the number of mines touching the particular cell. 

Future features: mine-marking with right click, and inability to blow up on the first click of a game.

To play, clone the repo, and after running the following commands, go to localhost port 8080:

npm install
npm run build
npm run dev-server
